# 2D-Transformations
Draws polygon based on vertices,

then you can rotate, 

resize, reflect about a line,

appply force to change its shape.

=>Part of the course 'Computer Graphics'.

4 quadrants are displayed.

NOTE: Give points of polygon in either cyclic or non cyclic order
Works fine for a single point and line. SIngle point (pixel) is too small to easily detect.
